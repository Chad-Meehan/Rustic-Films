# Rustic-Films

This is an initial site created for George Meehan of Rustic Films.
It is a profile site to provide info about George and his film making. It is used as a showcase.

This site was made utilizing W3-Schools style classes and also straight css.
There are photos of George and of the films he has done.

There is also a contact page that uses the emailJS.com email service to allow for contact messages to be sent straight to George.
